304 lines of data was written
it takes approximately 6 seconds per line
1800/4 = 300 so we are close

1800/5 should be 360 but close enough
300 Mb data
that 1.8 Gb for 3 hours approximately
we would be well within.

latitude and longitude do not match the web site very well.

I think we may have a problem with UTC ?

it works on a PC so the time problems of this computer/OS is the issue for sure. Probably it is okay.

took only 23 pictures even though every 25 should be 24 pictures.
size extrapolation gives us ~2.1 Gb we had 118 Mb of data from 10 minutes.
So we are safe even if we do not miss any.
